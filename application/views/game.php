            <h2>How to Play</h2>

            <p>There are eight different types of cards, shown below. Each card has a number, and an effect when played.</p>

            <p>Each player holds one card in their hand. When it's your turn, you draw a card, then play a card. </p>

            <p>Some cards end the round immediately and determine who wins. Others simply have an effect on gameplay. </p>

            <p>If no one ends the round by playing a card which ends the round, then the player holding the highest-value card at the end (when the deck runs out) wins. </p>

            <p>The winner of each round earns a point. The first player to earn seven points wins the game. Happy playing!</p>
